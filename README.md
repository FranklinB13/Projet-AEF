# Projet-AEF

Q2)
This C program defines structures and functions to work with finite automata. The structures include Transition for representing transitions between states and Noeud for creating a linked list of symbols. The main structure, Automate, captures the essence of the automaton, including the number of states, symbols, transitions, and a 3D matrix indicating state transitions based on symbols.

The verifierMot function takes an automaton and a linked list of symbols, attempting to verify whether the given word is recognized by the automaton. It iterates through the symbols, checks their validity, and traverses the automaton's transitions accordingly. The function prints whether the input word is recognized or not.

However, the code references a libererListe function for freeing memory allocated to the linked list, but its implementation is not provided. It is recommended to handle errors more explicitly and ensure proper memory management.

Q3)
This 3rd question provides a function, complete, which allows you to determine if a given automaton (Automaton) is complete. Let’s break down the function and associated structures:

Structures
    Transition: Represents a transition in the automation, with fields for initial and final states.
    Node: A node structure for a linked list, where each node contains an integer value and a pointer to the next node.
    Automaton: represents the automaton, containing the number of states (nbE), the number of symbols (nSy), a number of transitions and a 3D matrix (mat) for the transitions.
is_complete function
    Purpose: The function checks if the automation is complete. An automaton is considered complete if for each state, there is a transition defined for each symbol of the alphabet
    Implementation:
        The function goes through each symbol of the automaton alphabet (ALPHABET_SIZE).
        For each symbol, it goes through all the states of the automaton (automaton->state_count).
        The function calls is_transition_valid, presumably a function that checks if there is a valid transition for a given state and symbol in the automation.
        If is_transition_valid returns -1 for any state-symbol pair, this indicates a missing transition for that combination and the function returns 0, meaning the automaton is not complete.
        If all state-symbol combinations have valid transitions, the function returns 1, indicating that the automation is complete.
Potential problems
    The code references ALPHABET_SIZE, automaton->alphabet and is_transition_valid, which are not defined in the provided snippet. These are likely external to the function, and their correct implementation is crucial for is_complete to work correctly.
    The Automate structure does not have fields for alphabet and state_count, which are used in the function. This may be an oversight or they may be part of an extended structure not shown in the code snippet.
Generally
The is_complete function is part of a larger system managing finite automata. It checks whether each possible symbol-state combination in an automaton has a corresponding transition, thereby determining whether the automaton is complete


Q4)
We have 2 structures defined:
        Transition: Represents a transition in the automaton, with an initial state and a final state.
        Automaton: represents the automaton itself, containing the number of states (nbE), the number of symbols (nSy), a number of transitions (transition), and a three-dimensional matrix (mat) to represent the state transitions.
The completeAutomate function:
    This function is designed to complement a given automaton by ensuring that there is a defined transition for each combination of input state and symbol. To do this, it adds a special “phi” state which acts as a receiver of any undefined transitions.
    The function increases the number of states by one to accommodate the phi state.
    It reallocates memory to the transition matrix to include this new state.
    The function then iterates through each state and symbol, checking for missing transitions. If a transition is missing for a particular state and symbol, this adds a transition to the phi state.
Memory reallocation:
    The code reallocates memory to the mat array to adapt to the new state. This is done in a nested loop, indicating that mat is a 3D array where mat[i][j][k] represents a transition from state i with symbol j to state k.
Added transitions to the Phi state:
    The innermost loop checks each potential transition. If a transition is not found for a particular state-symbol pair, the function adds a transition to the phi state for that pair.
Possible improvements and issues:
    Memory allocation checks: The code does not check whether reallocation calls succeed. In a real application, it is crucial to check whether memory allocation and reallocation calls return NULL, in order to properly handle memory allocation failures.
    Freeing Memory: No code is provided to free allocated memory. It is essential to free allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
    Error handling: The code does not handle errors, for example in cases where invalid inputs are provided to the completeAutomate function.
