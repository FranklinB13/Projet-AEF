Overview
This program, developed by Franklin, Imane, Ance, and Yasmine, is designed to work with automata. It allows users to create, import, manipulate, and verify automata. The primary functionalities include creating a new automaton, importing an automaton from a file, displaying the automaton, saving the automaton to a file, checking if the automaton is complete, making the automaton complete, checking if the automaton is deterministic, making the automaton deterministic, and verifying a word against the automaton.


File Structure
main.c: Contains the main program logic.
autom.c and autom.h: Implement functions related to automata.
liste.c: Implements functions related to the word list.

Getting Started
Compile the program using a C compiler.
Run the executable.

Follow the on-screen menu to perform various actions.

Menu Options

Create a New Automaton: Allows the user to create a new automaton.

Import Automaton from File: Enables the user to import an automaton from a file.

Display Automaton: Shows the details of the currently loaded automaton.

Save Automaton to File: Saves the current automaton to a user-specified file.

Check Completeness of Automaton: Verifies if the automaton is complete.

Make Automaton Complete: Modifies the automaton to make it complete.

Check Determinism of Automaton: Checks if the automaton is deterministic.

Make Automaton Deterministic: Converts the automaton into a deterministic one.

Verify a Word: Allows the user to enter a word and checks if it is recognized by the automaton.

Quit: Exits the program after deleting the automaton.


Notes
Make sure to follow the on-screen instructions for each option.
The program may request user inputs for filenames or words during execution.
Feel free to explore the various functionalities and enjoy working with automata!
